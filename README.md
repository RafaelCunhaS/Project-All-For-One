## All For One

MySQL project made while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

The intent of the project was to create solutions involving the main commands and initial concepts of _SQL_ with the use of the Northwind database.

### Skills
With this project I was able to:

- Understand how the _Structured Query Language_ (SQL) is used;
- Comprehend how the tables fit in the concepts of a database;
- Comprehend what is a query and which are its commands types;
- Make queries and filters through the database with `SELECT`, `AS`, `CONCAT`, `DISTINCT`, `COUNT`, `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`, `ORDER BY`,
`WHERE`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`.
- `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` data from tables.
